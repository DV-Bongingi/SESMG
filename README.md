The **SESMG** provides a spreadsheet interface to the Open Energy Modeling Framework (oemof), allowing modeling and optimization of urban energy systems based a spreadsheet.

**SESMG** makes it easier to create oemof-based energy system models.

- You don't need to touch the command line
- You don't need programming skills
- **SESMG** is an intuitive spreadsheet driven tool

The components defined in this spreadsheet are defined with the included Python 
program and the open source Python library “oemof”, assembled to an energy system 
and optimized with open source solvers, e.g. “cbc”. The modeling results can be 
viewed and analyzed using a browser-based results output.)

## Quick Start ![how](https://cs.adelaide.edu.au/~christoph/badges/content-how-green.svg)

### Step 1) Download Python 3.7 or newer (Python 3.10 was not tested yet)

- go to the Python download page
- chose a Python version (e.g. “Python 3.7.6”) and click “download”
- download the operating system specific installer (e.g. “Windows x86-64 executable installer”)
- execute the installer on your computer

Linux only: 
- run `$ sudo update-alternatives --install /usr/bin/python3 python3 /usr/bin/python3.7 2`
- test by running `$ python3 --version`

### Step 2) Download the Spreadsheet Energy System Model Generator from GIT as .zip folder 

### Step 3) Extract the .zip folder into any directory on the computer. 

### Step 4) Install pip (Linux only)

run `$ sudo apt-get install python3-pip`

### Step 5) Install tkinter (Linux only)

run `$ sudo apt-get install python3.7-tk`

### Step 6) Download the CBC-solver (Windows and Linux only) 

#### For Windows:

Download [here](http://ampl.com/dl/open/cbc/cbc-win64.zip)

<u>Within this step there are two options: </u>
- install the cbc-Solver on your whole operating system 
- copy and paste the downloaded executable two your **SESMG**-working directory

#### For Linux:

run `$ sudo apt-get install coinor-cbc`

### Step 7) Install Graphviz (Windows and Linux only) 

#### For Windows:
Download [here](https://graphviz.gitlab.io/download/)

- select and download the graphviz version for your device (e.g. graphviz-2.38.msi for Windows)
- Execute the installation manager you just downloaded. Choose the following directory for the installation: “C:\Program Files (x86)\Graphviz2.38" (should be the default settings)

#### For Linux:

run `$ sudo apt-get install graphviz`

### Step 8) Start the operating system specific installation file.
