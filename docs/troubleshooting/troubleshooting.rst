Troubleshooting
*************************************************
During execution of the model generator, error messages and associated error messages may occur. 


**General debugging**:

Pay attention to the correct spelling:

- Pay attention to correct upper and lower case.
- Do not use spaces in the entire spreadsheet (except for the "comment" columns).
- Make sure that every column of the used lines is filled. Columns that are not used can be filled with a "0".

Make sure that the displayed system can stay in balance. 
- It must always be possible to take off all of the supplied energy and vice versa. 
- The use of excess-sinks and shortage-sources can help to keep the system in balance.
