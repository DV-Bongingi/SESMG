About the Model Generator
=========================
The Spreadsheet Energy System Model Generator allows the modeling and optimization of energy systems without the need for programming skills. 
The components defined in this spreadsheet are defined with the included Python program and the open source Python library "oemof", assembled 
to an energy system and optimized with the open source solver "cbc".
