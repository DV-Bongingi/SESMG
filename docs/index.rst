About the Model Generator
=========================

The Spreadsheet Energy System Model Generator allows the modeling 
and optimization of energy systems without the need for programming skills. 
The components defined in this spreadsheet are defined with the 
included Python program and the open source Python library "oemof", assembled 
to an energy system and optimized with the open source solver "cbc".

Structure of Energy Systems
---------------------------

Energy systems in the sense of the Spreadseet Energy System Model Generator are designed according to the 
specifications of the `oemof <https://oemof.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html>`_ library. Accordingly, 
energy systems can be represented with the help of mathematical graph theory. Thus, energy systems are 
exemplified as "graphs" consisting of sets of "vertices" and "edges". In more specific terms, vertices 
stand for components and buses while directed edges connect them. The status variable of the energy flow 
indicates which amount of energy is transported between the individual nodes at what time. Possible 
components of an oemof energy system are 

- sources,
- sinks,
- transformers, and
- storages. 

Buses furthermore form connection points of an energy system. The graph of a simple energy system 
consisting of each one source, one transformer, one sink, as well as two buses, could look like the 
example displayed in the following figure.

   :align: center

   Graph of a simple energy system, consisting of one source, two buses, one transformer, and one a sink.
  
An oemof energy system must be in equilibrium at all times. 
Therefore sources must always provide exactly as 
much energy as the sinks and transformer losses consume. 
In turn, the sink must be able to consume the entire amount 
of energy supplied. If there is no balance, 
oemof is not able to solve the energy system.

Buses
^^^^^

The modelling framework oemof does not allow direct connections 
between components. Instead, they must always 
be connected with a bus. The bus in turn can be connected 
to other components, so that energy can be transported via 
the bus. Buses can have any number of incoming and 
outgoing flows. Buses can not directly be connected with 
each other. They do not consider any conversion processes 
or losses.

Sources
^^^^^^^

Sources represent the provision of energy. This can either 
be the exploitation of of an energy source (e.g. 
gas storage reservoir or solar energy, no energy source in 
physical sense), or the simplified energy import from 
adjacent energy systems. While some sources may have 
variable performances, depending on the temporary needs of 
the energy system, others have fixed performances, 
which depend on external circumstances. In the latter case, 
the exact performances must be entered to the model in 
form of time series. With the help of oemofs “feedinlib” 
and “windpowerlib”, electrical outputs of photovoltaik 
(pv)-systems and wind power plants can be generated 
automatically. In order to ensure a balance in the energy 
system at all times, it may be useful to add a “shortage”
source to the energy system, which supplies energy 
in the event of an energy deficit. In reality, such a 
source could represent the purchase of energy at a fixed price.

Sinks
^^^^^

Sinks represent either energy demands within the energy system or 
energy exports to adjacent systems. Like sources, sinks can either
have variable or fixed energy demands. 
Sinks with variable demands adjust their consumption to the amount 
of energy available. This could for example stand for the sale of 
surplus electricity. However, actual consumers usually have fixed 
energy demands, which do not respond to amount of energy available 
in the system. As with sources, the exact demands of sinks can be 
passed to the model with the help of time series. 

In order to ensure a balance in the energy system at all times, 
it may be appropriate to add an “excess” sink to the energy system, 
which consumes energy in the event of energy surplus. In reality, 
this could be the sale of electricity or the give-away of heat to 
the atmosphere.

**Standard Load Profiles**

Oemof's sub-library `demandlib <https://demandlib.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ 
can be used for the estimation of heat and electricity demands of different 
consumer groups, as based on German standard load profiles (SLP). 
The following electrical standard load profiles of the Association 
of the Electricity Industry (VDEW) can be used:

+--------+---------------------------------------------------+

**Stochastic Load Profiles**

The use of standard load profiles has the disadvantage that they only represent 
the average of a larger number of households (> 200). Load peaks of individual 
households (e.g. through the use of hair dryers or electric kettles) are filtered 
out by this procedure. To counteract this, the Spreadsheet Energy System Model Generator offers the 
possibility to generate stochastic load profiles for residential buildings. 
These are generated on the basis of Richardsonpy. Thereby, an arbitrary number of different realistic load profiles
is simulated under consideration of statistic rules. The mean value of a large-enough
number of profiles should, again, result in the standard load profile. However, if calculations
are continued using the individual values before averaging – as in the above
calculation of costs – different values are obtained than when calculating with SLPs.

Transformers
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Transformers are components with one ore more input flows, which are 
transformed to one or more output flows. Transformers may be power 
plants, energy transforming processes 
(e.g., electrolysis, heat pumps), as well as transport lines with 
losses. The transformers’ efficiencies can be defined for every 
time step (e.g., the efficiency of a thermal 
powerplants in dependence of  the ambient temperature).

**Generic Transformers** are simply transforming an energy flow 
linearly into another one. A generic transformer’s efficiency 
remains the same regardless of the load point. 
transformers may have one or more different outputs, e.g., heat 
and electricity. For the modeling the nominal performance of a 
generic transformer with several outputs, the 
respective output ratios and an efficiency for each output need 
to be known.

The **GenericCHP**-transformer can be used to model different 
types of CHP plants, such as combined cycle extraction turbines, 
back pressure turbines, or motoric CHPs. For 
the individual outputs (electricity and heat), different nominal 
values and efficiencies can be defined. 

Links
^^^^^
Links can be used to connect two buses or to display transport losses of
networks. Links are not represented by a separate oemof class, they are
rather represented by transformers. In order to map a loss-free
connection between two buses, an efficiency of 1 is used. If a link is
undirected, a separate transformer must be used for each direction. 
In an energy system, links can represent, for
example, electrical powerlines, gas pipelines, district heating
distribution networks or similar.

Storages
^^^^^^^^
Storages are connected to a bus and can store energy from this bus and return it to a later point in time.

Investment
^^^^^^^^^^
The investment costs help to compare the costs of building new components to the costs of further using existing components instead. The annual savings from building new capacities 
should compensate the investment costs. The investment method can be applied to any new component to be built. In addition to the usual component parameters, the 
maximum installable capacity needs to be known. Further, the periodic costs need to be assigned to the investment costs. The periodic costs refer to the defined 
time horizon. If the time horizon is one year, the periodical costs correspond to the annualized capital costs of an investment.

Getting Started
===============

Installation
------------

1. Python version 3.5 or higher is required for the application of the Spreadsheet Energy System Model Generator Python. It can be freely `downloaded <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`_ and installed on any PC (Windows, Linux, Mac). 


2. Download the program files from `GIT <https://git.fh-muenster.de/ck546038/spreadsheet-energy-system-model-generator>`_ as .zip folder.


3. Extract the .zip folder into any directory on the computer.


Application of the Model Generator
----------------------------------

1. Fill in the spreadsheet document according to the instructions in the following chapter and save it under the name "scenario.xlsx" in the "data" folder.


2. Execute the program "Spreadsheet_Energy_System_Model_Generator.py" in the main folder of the program. This can be done either by double-clicking, or by opening the file in any Python interpreter. The latter variant allows a more detailed access to error messages etc. Running the program may take some time depending on the model size.


3. After running the program completely, the results can be viewed in the "results" folder. These consist of the "log.file" with details of the optimization, as well as an .xlsx file for each bus, in which the energy flows of the optimized energy system are stored. 


Using the Scenario File
----------------------

For the modeling and optimization of an energy system, parameters for all system components must be given in the model 
generator using the enclosed .xlsx file (editable with Excel, LibreOffice, …). The .xlsx file is divided into nine 
input sheets. In the “timesystem” sheet, general parameters are defined for the time horizon to be examined, in the 
sheets “buses”, “sinks”, “sources”, “transformers”, “storages” and “links” corresponding components are defined. In 
the sheet “time series”, the performance of individual components can be stored. In the “weather data” sheet, the 
required weather data is stored. When completing the input file, it is recommended to enter the energy system step by 
step and to perform test runs in between, so that potential input errors are detected early and can be localized more 
easily. In addition to the explanation of the individual input sheets, an example energy system is built step by step 
in the following subchapters. The input file for this example is stored in the program folder “examples” and viewed on 
`GIT <https://git.fh-muenster.de/ck546038/spreadsheet-energy-system-model-generator/tree/master/examples>`_. The following units are used throughout:

- capacity/performance in kW,
- energy in kWh,
- angles in degrees, and
- costs in cost units (CU).

Cost units are any scalable quantity used to optimize the energy system, such as euros or grams of carbon dioxide emissions.

Time series contain a value between 0 and 1 for each point in time, which indicates the proportion of installed capacity accounted for by the capacity produced at that point in time. In the header line, the name must be entered in the format "componentID.actual_value".

Weather Data
^^^^^^^^^^^^

If electrical load profiles are simulated with the Richardson tool, heating load profiles with the demandlib or 
photovoltaic systems with the feedinlib, weather data must be stored here. The weather 
data time system should be in conformity with the model’s time system, defined in the sheet “timesystem”.

- **timestamp**: Points in time to which the stored weather data are related. 
- **dhi**: diffuse horizontal irradiance in W/m$^2$
- **dirhi**: direct horizontal irradiance in W/m$^2$
- **pressure**: air pressure in Pa
- **windspeed**: Wind speed, measured at 10 m height, in unit m/s
- **z0**: roughness length of the environment in units m

Troubleshooting
===============
During execution of the model generator, error messages and associated program aborts may occur. In the following, known errors are 
listed and it is explained how they can be corrected.

.. code-block:: python

	" flowsum = source['sequences'].sum()
	KeyError: 'sequences' "
	
or

.. code-block:: python

	ApplicationError: Solver (cbc) did not exit normally

- **Error Cause**: At least one system component was entered incorrectly in the input file. 
- **Debugging**: For all components, make sure that 1) each column is filled correctly, and 2) the first component of a sheet is entered in the row directly below the header row, and that there are no blank rows between the individual components of a sheet

.. code-block:: python

	Memory Error
	
- **Error Cause**: The available memory is not sufficient to solve the model.
- **Debugging**: Take the following measures gradually until the error no longer occurs:

	- Restart the used Python interpreter
	- Close unnecessary programs on the computer
	- Make sure that  python 64 bit version is used (Python 32 bit can manage only 2 GB of memory).
	- Start the program on a more powerful computer.

.. code-block:: python

	AttributeError: module 'time' has no attribute 'clock'

- **Error Cause**: You are using a Python version not compatible with oemof.
- **Debugging**: Use Pyhton 3.7

.. code-block:: python

	ValueError: operands could not be broadcast together with shapes (8784,) (8760,) 

- **Error Cause**: The weather datasatu contains the wrong number of data points for using feedinlib.
- **Debugging**: Make sure that the number of weather data points corresponds to the time steps of the model (At hourly resolution, one year has 8760 time steps). When simulating a leap year, it is recommended limiting the time horizon to 8760 hours.
