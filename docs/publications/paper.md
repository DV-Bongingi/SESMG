# Summary

...

# Statement of need
Due to volatile renewable energy sources, the use of different energy storage systems, sector coupling, the growing importance of new sectors such as e-mobility and hydrogen usage [@Klemm.2023], as well as the increasing relevance of multiple planning objectives, it is becoming increasingly difficult to optimally design urban energy systems [@QUELLE]. In this context, urban energy systems are defined as “the combined process of acquiring and using energy in a given spatial entity with a high density and differentiation of residents, buildings, commercial sectors, infrastructure, and energy sectors (e.g., heat, electricity, fuels). They are also called mixed-used multi-energy systems” [@Klemm.Indicators]. Traditionally, such systems are designed by simulating and comparing a very few predefined energy supply scenarios. Mathematical optimization of the systems is usually not performed [@QUELLE]. In addition, individual buildings, consumption sectors, or energy sectors are rarely planned and designed holistically, but rather separately from each other [@Lukszo.2018]. Finally, planning processes are often driven only by financial interests, instead of considering additional planning objectives, such as minimizing greenhouse gas emissions or reducing final energy demands. To fully exploit all synergies and avoid conflicting interests of increasingly entangled energy systems [@Pfenninger.2014], it is necessary to carry out holistic planning [@Lukszo.2018]. Therefore, all energy sectors, planning objectives and an entire spatial entity should be considered within a holistic analysis [@QUELLE]. Thereby, not only certain, but all theoretically possible supply scenarios should be compared by using optimization algorithms [@QUELLE], to ensure that those scenarios are identified that allow the minimization of the planning objectives by a given ratio [@QUELLE].

The Spreadsheet Energy System Model Generator (SESMG) meets all these challenges by 
* considering the multi-energy system (MES) approach [@Mancarella.2016], 
* by carrying out multi-objective optimization by using the epsilon-constraint-method [@Mavrotas.2009], and
* enabling high spatial resolution results through the applicability of model-based methods for the reduction of computational effort [@Klemm.2023].
