  abstract = {Local and regional energy systems are becoming increasingly entangled. Therefore, models for optimizing these energy systems are becoming more and more complex and the required computing resources (run-time and random access memory usage) are increasing rapidly. The computational requirements can basically be reduced solver-based (mathematical optimization of the solving process) or model-based (simplification of the real-world problem in the model). This paper deals with identifying how the required computational requirements for solving optimization models of multi-energy systems with high spatial resolution change with increasing model complexity and which model-based approaches enable to reduce the requirements with the lowest possible model deviations.},

  abstract = {Background:\hspace{0.6em} Urban energy systems are responsible for 75\% of the world's energy consumption and for 70\% of the worldwide greenhouse gas emissions. Energy system models are used to optimize, benchmark and compare such energy systems with the help of energy sustainability indicators. We discuss several indicators for their basic suitability and their response to changing boundary conditions, system structures and reference values. The most suitable parameters are applied to four different supply scenarios of a real-world urban energy system. Results:\hspace{0.6em} There is a number of energy sustainability indicators, but not all of them are suitable for the use in urban energy system optimization models. Shortcomings originate from the omission of upstream energy supply chains (secondary energy efficiency), from limited capabilities to compare small energy systems (energy productivity), from excessive accounting expense (regeneration rate), from unsuitable accounting methods (primary energy efficiency), from a questionable impact of some indicators on the overall system sustainability (self-sufficiency), from the lack of detailed information content (share of renewables), and more. On the other hand, indicators of absolute greenhouse gas emissions, energy costs, and final energy demand are well suitable for the use in optimization models. However, each of these indicators only represents partial aspects of energy sustainability; the use of only one indicator in the optimization process increases the risk that other important aspects will deteriorate significantly, eventually leading to suboptimal or even unrealistic scenarios in practice. Therefore, multi-criteria approaches should be used to enable a more holistic optimization and planning of sustainable urban energy systems. Conclusion:\hspace{0.6em} We recommend multi-criteria optimization approaches using the indicators of absolute greenhouse gas emissions, absolute energy costs, and absolute energy demand. For benchmarking and comparison purposes, specific indicators should be used and therefore related to the final energy demand, respectively, the number of inhabitants.},

  abstract = {Energy systems models are important methods used to generate a range of insight and analysis on the supply and demand of energy. Developed over the second half of the twentieth century, they are now seeing increased relevance in the face of stringent climate policy, energy security and economic development concerns, and increasing challenges due to the changing nature of the twenty-first century energy system. In this paper, we look particularly at models relevant to national and international energy policy, grouping them into four categories: energy systems optimization models, energy systems simulation models, power systems and electricity market models, and qualitative and mixed-methods scenarios. We examine four challenges they face and the efforts being taken to address them: (1) resolving time and space, (2) balancing uncertainty and transparency, (3) addressing the growing complexity of the energy system, and (4) integrating human behavior and social risks and opportunities. In discussing these challenges, we present possible avenues for future research and make recommendations to ensure the continued relevance for energy systems models as important sources of information for policy-making. \& 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

  abstract = {There is growing recognition that decarbonisation of existing uses of electricity is only `part of the story' and that closer attention needs to be given to demand for energy in heating or cooling and in transport, and to all the energy vectors and infrastructures that supply the end-use demand. In this respect, concepts such as `multi-energy systems' (MES) have been put forward and are gaining increasing momentum, with the aim of identifying how multiple energy systems that have been traditionally operated, planned and regulated in independent silos can be integrated to improve their collective technical, economic, and environmental performance. This paper addresses the need for modelling of MES which is capable of assessing interactions between different sectors and the energy vectors they are concerned with, so as to bring out the benefits and potential unforeseen or undesired drawbacks arising from energy systems integration. Drivers for MES modelling and the needs of different users of models are discussed, along with some of the practicalities of such modelling, including the choices to be made in respect of spatial and temporal dimensions, what these models might be used to quantify, and how they may be framed mathematically. Examples of existing MES models and tools and their capabilities, as well as of studies in which such models have been used in the authors' own research, are provided to illustrate the general concepts discussed. Finally, challenges, opportunities and recommendations are summarised for the engagement of modellers in developing a new range of analytical capabilities that are needed to deal with the complexity of MES.},
