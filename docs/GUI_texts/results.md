# Result Processing
The result processing shows the complex results of the optimization. A differentiation is made between a single-objective optimization (1) and a multi-objective optimization (2). Depending on the type of optimization, the result preparation differs. 
1. In single-objective optimization, the following results are displayed:
    - Result Overvies: Overview of costs, emissions, energy demand of the district
    - Energy System Graph: Graph which shows the energy system model.
    - Result Tabel: Table which shows all components of the energ system model with data like costs, emissions etc.
    - Interactive Results: Dashboard to view load profiles of all components (e.g. electricity load profiles of a building)
    - *coming soon: building-specific results of a possible energy supply*
2. In the multi-objective optimization the following results are displayed:
    - Pareto Diagram: Diagram which shows the costs and emissions of each scenario (pareto point)
    - Energy quantity diagrams: Heat and electricity amount diagrams to show the energy supply at each scenario 
    - All results described under 1 for each scenario
