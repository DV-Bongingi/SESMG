Demo Tool
*************************************************

With the help of the demo tool a descriptive introduction to energy system modeling can be given. 
The demo tool has been implemented for training purposes and is not intended for the actual analysis of a real energy system.

Users have the possibility to integrate different energy supply technologies into a defined municipal energy system. 
If possible, the technologies should be dimensioned in such a way that the monetary costs of the entire system and/or 
the carbon dioxide emissions are reduced. 

With the help of the demo tool the chosen energy supply scenario can be simulated by simply entering performance values 
(monetary costs and CO2 emissions) and then compared graphically with the stored optimized scenarios.

   Interface of the Demo Tool
   
1: Tab to select the demo tool

2: Input of the supply scenario to be simulated

3: Start of the simulation

4: Output of results

5: Storage of the intermediate results shown in (4) for display in the results output (8 and 10)

6: Input of already known simulation results (e.g. from previous simulation runs). By using this function, computing time can be saved.

7: Storage of the values from (6) for display in the result output

8: Display of a scatter plot for all saved scenarios

9: Adoption of optimized and status-quo scenarios in the output of results

10: Display of a bar plot for all saved scenarios

11: Overview of the stored system parameters
