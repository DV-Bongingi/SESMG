Spreadsheet Energy System Model Generator
=========================================

The Spreadsheet Energy System Model Generator allows the modeling and 
optimization of energy systems without the need for programming skills. 
The components defined in this spreadsheet are defined with the included Python 
program and the open source Python library “oemof”, assembled to an energy system 
and optimized with the open source solver “cbc”. The modeling results can be 
viewed and analyzed using a browser-based results output.
